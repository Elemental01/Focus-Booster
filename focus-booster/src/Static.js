                    <pre>
                    The Pomodoro technique is a time-management method that uses a timer to break down work into<br></br> intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are known as <br></br>"Pomodoros",The Pomodoro technique is based on the idea that frequent breaks can improve mental<br></br> agility and productivity. By working in short, focused bursts, followed by brief rest periods, you can <br></br>maintain a high level of concentration and motivation throughout the day.
